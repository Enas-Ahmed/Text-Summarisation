# Text-Summarisation

## Introduction
This project aims to implement and compare various automatic text summarization methods, including extractive and abstractive approaches. The goal is to understand the implementation time, accuracy, and human-like quality of the generated summaries.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Extreme Summarization (XSum) dataset, which contains over 226,000 news articles from BBC along with single-sentence summaries. The dataset covers a wide range of domains such as news, politics, sports, business, and more.

## Preprocessing
### The key preprocessing steps include:

##### Extracting article domains using regular expressions
##### Analyzing statistics on the article and summary lengths for a subset of 3,000 articles
##### Identifying the most prevalent domains (news, sports, business, politics)
##### Cleaning the text by removing HTML tags, punctuation, digits, stop words, etc.
##### Converting all text to lowercase

## Methodology
### The project explores various text summarization techniques, including:

##### Extractive summarization
##### Abstractive summarization
##### Concepts related to NLP tasks like topic modeling and sentiment analysis
##### Unsupervised machine learning approaches like clustering

## Objectives
##### Implement and compare the performance of different automatic summarization methods.
##### Evaluate the summaries in terms of implementation time, accuracy, and human-like quality.
##### Gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each summarization technique.

## Anticipated Outcomes
This project aims to provide valuable insights into the implementation, performance, and quality of various automatic text summarization methods using the XSum dataset.
